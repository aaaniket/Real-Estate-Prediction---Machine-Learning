# Real-Estate-Prediction-Machine-Learning


Real estate price prediction is a critical aspect of the real estate market and broader economic landscape. It serves as a cornerstone for investors, developers, and homeowners alike, facilitating informed decision-making, strategic investment planning, and effective risk management.

In this context, a dataset comprising 414 entries has been provided, offering detailed insights into real estate transactions. The dataset encompasses a diverse set of features known to influence real estate pricing dynamics:

1. **Transaction Date**: Indicating the timing of property transactions, allowing for temporal analysis and trend identification.
2. **House Age**: Reflecting the maturity of properties in years, providing insights into their condition and potential renovation needs.
3. **Distance to Nearest MRT Station**: A crucial factor for convenience and accessibility, measured in meters, which significantly influences property desirability and pricing.
4. **Number of Convenience Stores**: Representing the count of nearby convenience stores, serving as a proxy for the availability of basic amenities and neighborhood attractiveness.
5. **Latitude and Longitude**: Geographical coordinates of properties, offering valuable location-based insights, including proximity to urban centers, scenic areas, or other relevant landmarks.
6. **House Price of Unit Area**: The target variable for prediction, denoting the price per unit area of houses, serving as a key indicator of property value and market competitiveness.

Notably, the dataset is comprehensive and meticulously curated, devoid of missing values, thereby ensuring robustness and reliability for predictive modeling endeavors.

The overarching objective is to develop a sophisticated predictive model capable of accurately forecasting house prices per unit area based on the amalgamation of various influential features. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and harnessing the wealth of information encapsulated within the dataset, stakeholders can gain actionable insights into real estate pricing dynamics, empowering them to make informed investment decisions and navigate the real estate market landscape with confidence.
